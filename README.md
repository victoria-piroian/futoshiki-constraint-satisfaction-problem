# futoshiki-constraint-satisfaction-problem
Built a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver implementing Forward Checking, Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC), and the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic. Designed two CSP models to solve Futoshiki puzzles using binary and n-ary constraints, emphasizing correctness, efficiency, and scalability.
